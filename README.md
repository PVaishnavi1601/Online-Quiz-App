# Online-Quiz-App
Create a console-based quiz application.

This is a console-based quiz application developed using Java. The project aims to simulate a simple quiz where the user is presented with multiple-choice questions, inputs their answers, and receives a score at the end. The application demonstrates basic object-oriented programming principles such as classes, lists, and user input handling.
->A list (or array) is used to store questions and options.
->User inputs are taken via the console and compared to correct answers.
->The score is updated and displayed at the end.

Deliverables:
-Java class to handle:
-Quiz questions and options
-User responses
-Scoring and result display
